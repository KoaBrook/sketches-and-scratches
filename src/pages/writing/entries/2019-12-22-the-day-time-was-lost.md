title: The Day Time Was Lost
description: >-
  One day, time is lost. How such a thing can even happen is unclear, but happen
  it does. Now travelling to different times is as simple as walking from one
  room to another and two friends plan to do just that. Hopping from one time to
  another they search for an answer to the question of what happened the day
  time was lost?
