  In a world where humans are gone, animals inexplicably develop the capacity to
  speak , build and live together in relative harmony. One problem; whatever
  caused the humans to disappear also took all the large animals. One rat will
  go on a quest to bring them back. On the way he will meet great companions,
  make fearsome enemies and confront the hard truth about what really happened
  to the humans.
