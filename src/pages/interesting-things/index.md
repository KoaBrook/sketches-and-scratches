### When writing I take inspiration from many, many different places and have learnt many interesting things. I'd like to share some of these things on Sketches & Scratches in the hopes they might inspire you too!

For now you can read articles on the art & artists which inspired my first novel Sketch.

Soon I will add some stuff on time travel & scientific theory from the research I did on my second book The Day Time Was Lost.

Later on I will add a section on animals & nature.
