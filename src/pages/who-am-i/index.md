Good question! Who are any of us really?

Well, my name is Jack Owen.

As my name implies I like to consider myself a ‘Jack of All Trades’. I’m a writer, actor, teacher and a friend to anyone who needs it.

I’m English but I don’t live in England. In fact I love to live everywhere and travel at any/every opportunity I can. Wherever I go I discover new people, things and stories.

Through writing I’ve discovered many fascinating and inspiring things which I would like to share on Sketches & Scratches.

I've written 5 novels but published exactly none! This is something I'm hoping to remedy and you can help! Please consider joining my mailing list for any updates I post.

Also, feel free to shoot me an email if you like.
