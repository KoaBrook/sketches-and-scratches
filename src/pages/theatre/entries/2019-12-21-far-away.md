War, Paranoia and... hats.

Caryl Churchill's Far Away follows the life of a girl living in a world in which war is constant and ubiquitous. The play invites the audience to question at what point does one become desensitised to atrocity, how can you protect yourself when everything is dangerous and what is real when everything is abstract?
