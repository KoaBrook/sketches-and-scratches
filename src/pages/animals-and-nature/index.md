### Animals are smart, very smart. What would happen if they were even smarter and if there were no humans around to control them?

In a world where humans are gone, animals inexplicably develop the capacity to speak , build and live together in relative harmony. One problem; whatever caused the humans to disappear also took all the large animals. One rat will go on a journey to bring them back. On the way he will meet great companions, make fearsome enemies and confront the hard truth about what really happened to the humans.

When I wrote my book about animals living in a post-human world I was inspired by all the beautiful and unique creatures that walk our Earth.

Soon I will post some articles about some of the animals that inspired me and made it into my book.
